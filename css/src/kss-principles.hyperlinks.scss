// Hyperlinks
//
// It is recommended not to style `<a>` elements without the `[href]` attribute.
// Such elements are “placeholder anchors”, which do not lead anywhere.
// These placeholders should not be visibly discernable from surrounding prose,
// as they merely represent placeholders for where hyperlinks *could* be placed,
// or anchors whose references may change based on context.
// Therefore, any styling of “live” hyperlinks should be done with the `a[href]` selector.
// More information is available in the
// [HTML Recommendation](https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/textlevel-semantics.html#the-a-element).
//
// The reasoning behind this principle is that we may have a situation in which
// a possible hyperlink may be added, which is not yet determined at compile time.
// For example this could be done via front-end script, after the user loads the page;
// another example would be where a template wraps a component with an anchor,
// in the event that whether the component is linkable is based on a database entry.
// In these situations and we cannot change the element on the fly
// (e.g. we cannot change a `<span>` to an `<a>`),
// thus it is best practice to use a placeholder anchor (`<a>` element),
// and than use logic to adjust the attributes if and when necessary.
//
// It is advised to put the `[role="none"]` attribute on anchor placeholders,
// so that assistive technology does not misidentify them as active hyperlinks.
// When an anchor placeholder does become a live hyperlink, the `[href]` attribute should be added
// (whose value is the target’s URL), and `[role="none"]` should be removed.
//
// Link color should have sufficient contrast with the background color
// *as well as* sufficient contrast with surrounding non-link text color.
// Read [Technique G183](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G183.html) for details.

// - Background contrast ratio:
//   - to meet AA  level: 4.5 normal; 3.0 large (18pt or 14pt bold)
//   - to meet AAA level: 7.0 normal; 4.5 large (18pt or 14pt bold)
// - Surrounding text contrast ratio:
//   - 3.0 for all
//
// Weight: 2
