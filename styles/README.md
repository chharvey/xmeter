**IMPORTANT**

This folder, `/styles/`, is *DEPRECATED* and left here for backwards-compatibility.
Do not reference or `@import` any files from this folder.
Instead, reference the source files in `/src/`.

This folder, `/styles/`, will be DELETED in v6. **If you upgrade to v6 without updating your
references, your stylesheets will break.**

Latest update: `2017-03-02`. This overrides any previous specifications of
using `/styles/` instead of `/src/` as the folder of stylesheet partials.
